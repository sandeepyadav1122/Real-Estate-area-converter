## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. Extract the Project Files
- Locate your downloaded ZIP file
- Right-click and extract to a folder where you want to store the project
- Name it something easy to remember like **"land-area-converter"**

### 2. Open the Project in Your Code Editor
- Open **Visual Studio Code**
- Go to **File → Open Folder**
- Navigate to and select your extracted project folder

### 3. Open a Terminal
- In VS Code: **View → Terminal** (or press `Ctrl+` on Windows/Linux, `⌘+` on Mac)
- This opens a command line interface at the bottom of your editor

### 4. Install Dependencies
- In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
- This will download all required packages (**React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, etc.**)
- This might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed

### 5. Start the Development Server
- Once installation completes, type:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
- This command starts a local development server
- Wait for the message indicating the server is running (usually shows a local URL)

### 6. View Your Project
- Open your web browser
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`
- You should now see the **Land Area Converter** running!

### 7. Making Changes (Optional)
#### Main files you might want to modify:
- `src/components/LandAreaConverter.tsx` - The main converter functionality
- `src/components/UnitSelector.tsx` - The dropdown for selecting units
- `src/index.css` - Styling and theme customization
- After making changes, save the file, and the browser will automatically refresh

## Troubleshooting

### "npm not found" error:
- Make sure **Node.js** is properly installed.
- Open a new terminal and type:
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```
  to verify installation.

### Port already in use:
- If **port 8080** is already being used, the terminal will show an error. In this case, you can either:
  - Close the other application using that port, or
  - Edit the **vite.config.ts** file and change the port number (e.g., from `8080` to `3000`)

### Blank screen or errors in browser:
- Check the **browser console** (`F12` or right-click → Inspect → Console) for error messages
